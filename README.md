This project implements methods described in "An Unbiased Second-Order Prior for High-Accuracy Motion Estimation"
written by Trobin, Pock, Cremers, and Bischof.

The provided code is a building block for a larger project involving high-accuracy edge detection of depth map
images retrieved from a Kinect camera.  The aforementioned project can be viewed at GITHUB_LINK.

This code can be run on NVidia GPUs of CC 1.2 or greater.
