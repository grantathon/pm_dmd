This project implements methods described in "An Unbiased Second-Order Prior for High-Accuracy Motion Estimation" written by Trobin, Pock, Cremers, and Bischof.

The provided code is a building block for a larger project involving high-accuracy edge detection of depth map images retrieved from a Kinect camera.

The code for pm_dmd can be run on NVidia GPUs of CC 1.2 or greater.
